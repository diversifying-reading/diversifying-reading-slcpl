      <h2>Our Mission</h2>

      <p>Our goal with this project is to curate a collection of books that celebrates
        diversity in people, but also in content. We’re confident that you can find
        a book you love, whether you refine by genre or by representation.
        Happy reading!</p>

    <h2 align="center">Why Diversity in Books is Important</h2>
    <p align="center">
      Diverse representation in books allows for members of minority
      groups–especially kids–to see themselves represented authentically,
      with written characters and interactions that reflect their own.
      It also lets people whose identities lie outside of those groups to
      connect with, empathize, and educate themselves about people
      different from themselves. Diverse media in general, but especially
      diverse literature helps provide, as the National Education
      Association put it, windows or mirrors. Mirrors are there for people
      to see in others the identity and lifestyle they see in themselves and
      the people around them. Windows are there for outsiders to see in
      others what they don’t see in themselves. These two practices help
      build empathy, understanding, and awareness for people who don’t
      share your race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexuality, or socio-economic status.

    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>This project started out as a part of the City Library's summer volunteer program
      called Teen Squad. It was a personal project choice that spoke to our values and interests. We
      spent a lot of our summer, outside the in-person volunteer hours, working on
      this project. Through this, we have been able to attend the Utah Library Association
      annual conference and get access to so many amazing oppurtinites through the library.
